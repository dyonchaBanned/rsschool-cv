### About Me:

I decided on a direction in programming from my first years of university. My choice was Frontend Development. The main reason for that was the huge amount of self-study materials freely available.
During my university studies I acquired good teamwork skills, and I consider them my greatest strength. I was also doing freelance website layout at the time.
At the moment I am working hard on self-study to get a job as a Frontend Developer.

    function order(words){
        let wordsArr = words.split(' ');
        let wordPosition;
        let result = [];

        for(let word of wordsArr){
            wordPosition = parseInt(word.match(/\d+/));

            result[wordPosition - 1] = word;
